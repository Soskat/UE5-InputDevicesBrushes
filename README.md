# Input Devices Brushes

Tired of recreating over and over again databases with UI brushes representing various input devices buttons?

Well, this plugin might be for you!

This content-only plugin contains a set of UCommonInputBaseControllerData databases that can be used to retrive data of input devices buttons UI images. It is completely based on built-in Unreal [CommonUI](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/common-ui-plugin-for-advanced-user-interfaces-in-unreal-engine/) plugin - no need to install third-party items.

Right now it contains only a fraction of controller types (most popular/recent ones: Mouse&Keyboard, Xbox Series and PS5), but this list might be updated in nearest future.
